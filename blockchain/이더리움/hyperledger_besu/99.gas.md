Gas Limit

1. **Resource Constraint**: Each operation or computational step in a transaction consumes a certain amount of gas. By setting a gas limit, the network ensures that transactions cannot consume more computational resources than what is specified by this limit. Therefore, attackers cannot overwhelm the network by submitting transactions that consume excessive resources.
2. **Cost Control**: Gas acts as a measure of computational effort and has associated costs. Miners or validators are incentivized to process transactions based on the gas fees they can collect. By setting a gas limit, the network ensures that miners prioritize transactions with higher gas fees, encouraging efficient use of computational resources.
3. **Preventing Infinite Loops**: Transactions with loops or complex computations could potentially run indefinitely, consuming excessive resources. Gas limits prevent this by ensuring that transactions have a finite amount of gas available. If the gas limit is reached before the transaction completes, it is automatically reverted, preventing infinite execution loops.
4. **Economic Disincentive**: Exceeding the gas limit results in the transaction being reverted, and the sender loses the gas fees they provided with the transaction. This economic disincentive discourages users from attempting to overwhelm the network with transactions that consume excessive resources.

Yes, in public blockchain networks like Ethereum, users need to pay gas fees to execute transactions. Gas fees are essential for incentivizing miners (or validators) to include transactions in blocks and process them on the network. Gas fees compensate miners for the computational resources they expend to validate and execute transactions.

When a user submits a transaction to the network, they specify the gas price (the amount of cryptocurrency they are willing to pay per unit of gas) and the gas limit (the maximum amount of gas they are willing to consume for the transaction). The total fee for executing the transaction is calculated as the gas price multiplied by the gas used during execution.

If the gas limit specified by the user is insufficient to cover the computational cost of executing the transaction, the transaction will fail due to an out-of-gas error. In such cases, the gas fees are still paid to the miner who attempted to execute the transaction, but the transaction itself is not executed.

Therefore, paying gas fees is a fundamental aspect of interacting with public blockchain networks, ensuring the integrity and security of the network while providing incentives for miners to maintain the network's operation.
