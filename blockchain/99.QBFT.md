One prominent and the recommended enterprise-grade consensus protocol designed for private enterprise networks is the Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (QBFT). QBFT, developed by ConsenSys in partnership with JP Morgan, is an extension of the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus algorithm, incorporating modifications and enhancements tailored for enterprise use cases.

It is implemented by ConsenSys in both Quorum and Besu. Besu is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Hyperledger umbrella, offers robust support for QBFT(and now backed by Web3 Labs through our Hyperledger Besu support), allowing organisations to leverage its features for building and deploying secure and scalable private blockchains. 

As compared to IBFT, QBFT is optimised, modified and enhanced 

- Ambiguous Specification in IBFT: IBFT's specification have been ambiguous or left open to interpretation due to the use of natural language and pseudocode
- Reduction of the number of messages exchanged - Round Change message complexity reduced from n3 to n2
- Chain Forking Prevention: Chain forking was possible in IBFT in different scenarios
- Weak-liveness of the IBFT: Block production could get stuck
