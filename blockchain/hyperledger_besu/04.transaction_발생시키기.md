In a Clique consensus network, validators (nodes) are determined by the addresses specified in the genesis file under `"alloc"`. Other nodes can join the network later, but they will not be considered validators unless their addresses are added to the `"alloc"` section and they have appropriate permissions to participate in consensus.



In this example, `"fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73"` is the Ethereum address of a validator. The private key associated with this address is also provided for signing blocks. The `"balance"` field specifies the initial balance of this account.

When a Besu node starts up with this genesis file, it will recognize the accounts listed in the `"alloc"` section as validators and attempt to synchronize with them to participate in the Clique consensus algorithm.
