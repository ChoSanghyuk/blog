 the main difference between Hibernate and JPA is that Hibernate is a framework whereas JPA is an API specification focused mainly on ORM.

Hibernate implements a standard version of JPA, with a few new features unique to Hibernate.



## JPA

Java Persistence API, a Java specification that provides an object mapping facility to relational databases for Java applications. It provides a mechanism for managing persistence and object-relational mapping. JPA defines these mappings internally rather than depending on vendor-specific implementations. It does not do operations by itself; instead, it uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools like TopLink, Hibernate, etc.



JPA represents how to define POJO (Plain Old Java Object) as an entity and manage it with relations using some meta configurations.
