The `ctx` variable, which is a `context.Context` object created by `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 1*time.Second)`, and `c`, which is a `*fiber.Ctx` object, are not related.

The `context.Context` object (`ctx`) is a standard Go interface used for carrying deadlines, cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes. It's often used in functions that call external services, like database queries or HTTP requests, to provide a way to cancel those operations if they take too long.

The `*fiber.Ctx` object (`c`), on the other hand, is specific to the Fiber framework. It represents the context for the current HTTP request and provides methods for reading the request and writing the response.
